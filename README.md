# deep-learning-seminaari
These are the lecture notes for the TUT PLA-79100 course. In the course we went through the book Deep Learning (2016) by Goodfellow et al. and these are the presentable notes created. Initially they were ment for personal use only, so any enhancement proposals are welcome through pull requests.
