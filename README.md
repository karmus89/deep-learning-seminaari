# deep-learning-seminaari

These are the lecture notes in Finnish for the TUT PLA-79100 course. In the course we went through the book Deep Learning (2016) by Goodfellow et al. and these are the presentable notes created. Initially they were ment for personal use only, so any enhancement proposals are welcome through pull requests.

To use and edit these files a Python installation with Jupyter package is required, while the contents are viewable within this Github repo. The notebooks for each chapter can be found under the folder `notebooks`.

The notebooks are slided. This means that they are presentable in the browser as they are by going to `/notebooks` and running the following command:

    jupyter nbconvert *.ipynb --to slides --post serve

Remember to replace the asterisk with the proper filename.

All diagrams have been made with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).
